1. Population state wise

SELECT   state_name,
         Sum(total_population) AS population
FROM     state s
JOIN     population p
ON       s.state_code=p.state_code
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY state_name 

2. Percentage of literacy gender wise of each state

SELECT   state_name,
         round((Sum(male_literate)  / Sum(male))*100)    AS male_literacy_percentage ,
         round((sum(female_literate)/ sum(female)) *100) AS female_literacy_percentage
FROM     state s
JOIN     population p
ON       s.state_code=p.state_code
JOIN     literacy l
ON       s.state_code=l.state_code
GROUP BY s.state_name
ORDER BY s.state_name 

3. State having maximum population
SELECT   state_name,
         Sum(total_population)
FROM     state s
JOIN     population p
ON       s.state_code=p.state_code
GROUP BY s.state_name
HAVING   Sum(total_population)=
         (
                  SELECT   Sum(total_population)
                  FROM     population p
                  GROUP BY p.state_code
                  ORDER BY Sum(total_population) DESC
